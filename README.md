Hiring Prediction Project
📌 Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning–based hiring salary prediction system using Python and Jupyter Notebook, where a Linear Regression model is trained on candidate data such as years of experience, test scores, and interview scores, including preprocessing steps like handling missing values and converting text-based numbers into numerical form using Pandas, NumPy, and word2number, making it a beginner-friendly yet practical project that demonstrates core concepts of data cleaning, feature engineering, regression modeling, and prediction, suitable for academic mini projects, interview preparation, and showcasing fundamental machine learning skills
